3.35.3 - January 6, 2020
=============================

More or less every thing has changed. The main window layout has been completely
rewritten, based on the one of Reversi (Iagno, 3.34). It is now using a New Game
screen, in which you enter using a New Game button in the headerbar. Preferences
dialog has been removed; there is now a Sound toggle in the hamburger menu, with
also an Appearance submenu for switching theme. The game board had various fixes
and changes, notably a delay added before computer moves (that solves the bug on
“down” holding), and the blinking for every winning lines. There is also a basic
command-line support (for setting level, board size, and sound state, or getting
release version), a new Keyboard Shortcuts dialog, and D-Bus activation support.
