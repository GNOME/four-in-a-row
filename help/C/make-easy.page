<section id="undo">
  <title>Change your last move</title>

  <p>When the computer makes a winning move because of your last move or when
  you accidentally make the wrong move, you can undo your last move and change
  it. To undo your last move, select <guiseq><gui style="menu">Game</gui>
  <gui style="menuitem">Undo Move</gui></guiseq> or press
  <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>Z</key></keyseq>. You can now drop your marble at
  a different square in the game area to change your move.</p>

  <note style="info">
    <p>You can undo all your moves starting from your current move until you
    reach a favourable state of the game, or until the beginning of your current
    game, by pressing <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>Z</key></keyseq>
    repeatedly.</p>

<section id="hint">
  <title>Use hints</title>

  <p>If you are not sure of your next move, you can use a hint. When you use a
  hint, your marble moves to the top of the column that is the best choice,
  strategy-wise, and blinks. You can then drop your marble into that column. To
  use a hint, select <guiseq><gui style="menu">Game</gui>
  <gui style="menuitem">Hint</gui></guiseq> or press
  <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>H</key></keyseq>.</p>

  <note style="info">
  <p>There is no limit on the number of hints you can use in a game.</p>
