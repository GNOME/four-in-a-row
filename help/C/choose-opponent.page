    <desc>Change the level at which the computer plays or play with a
    friend.</desc>
  </info>

  <title>Choose a different opponent </title>
  <p>By default, your opponent in <app>Four-in-a-row</app> is the computer,
  playing at level one.</p>

  <steps>
    <title>To change the level, or to play with a friend:</title>
    <item>
      <p>Select <guiseq><gui style="menu">Settings</gui>
      <gui style="menuitem">Preferences</gui>
      <gui style="menuitem">Game</gui></guiseq>. You will see
      <gui>Player One</gui> and <gui>Player Two</gui>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Choose <gui style="radiobutton">Human</gui> for both players if want to
      play with a friend or family member.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, choose the level at which the computer plays. Choose
      between <gui style="radiobutton">Level one</gui>,
      <gui style="radiobutton">Level two</gui> or
      <gui style="radiobutton">Level three</gui>, where
      <gui style="radiobutton">Level one</gui> is the
      easiest level and <gui style="radiobutton">Level three</gui> is the most
      difficult level.</p>
      <note style="tip">
	<p>If you are playing with a friend or family member,
	<gui>Player One</gui> gets to play first in the first game of
	<app>Four-in-a-row</app>. In subsequent games, the chance to play first
	is given alternately to each player. So, <gui>Player Two</gui> will get
	to play first in the second game, <gui>Player One</gui> can play first
	in the third game and so on.</p>
