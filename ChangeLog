	* Ooops! Missed the pixmap directory.

2001-04-04  Dave Neary <bolsh@gimp.org>

	* Finished port of gnect to the GNOME 2.0 API. It even
	  compiles and runs properly with DISABLE_DEPRECATED set.
	  Main changes are:
	  - Uses of GnomePropertyBox replaced by GtkDialog
	  - Themes use #RRGGBB instead of the old format
          - Signals are handled quite differently -
            g_signal_connect() replaces gtk_signal_connect, and
	    the "response" signal is used for most dialogs.
          I also fixed the bit that needed white_ob.cn4 to be in
	  /usr/share/gnect. It now goes (correctly) into
	  ${prefix}/share/gnect and gets found there.

2001-12-21  Tim Musson <trmusson@ihug.co.nz>

	* Misc. changes to gnect-1.4.2 (mostly just removing the original
	  configure/build stuff) for addition to gnome-games.
