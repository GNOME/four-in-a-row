   A family classic, the objective of Four-in-a-row is to build a line of four
   of your marbles while trying to stop your opponent (human or computer) from
   building a line of his or her own. A line can be horizontal, vertical or
   diagonal. The first player to connect four in a row is the winner!

   Four-in-a-row features multiple difficulty levels. If you're having trouble,
   you can always ask for a hint.
